 My AI Bestie: Productivity & Focus Tracker

This project means a lot to me. I built it with my situation in mind. Trying to see if I can come up with something that could help me stay focused, be honest with myself, and make the most of my time. 
It's my way of applying everything Iâ€™ve been learning in data science and AI in a way thatâ€™s real and useful.



 Why I Built This

Like many people, I struggle with distractions, scattered focus, and inconsistency. I wanted a simple tool that could help me:

- Set goals that matter each day  
- Reflect on what actually happened (good or bad)  
- Get gentle AI nudges when I drift  
- Track my progress visually  
- Be more intentional with my time

And most importantly, I wanted it to feel like I had a friendly coach (or "bestie") supporting me, without judgment.



 What It Does

- Set multiple goals anytime
- Journal how the day went & note distractions
- Get AI feedback based on your reflection
- Mark goals as completed or not
- Visualize your progress over time
- Use it on any browser, even your phone
